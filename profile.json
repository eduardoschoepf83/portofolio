        "summary": "Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Eduardo Schoepf, and my journey into the world of software development began in 2016, when I obtained my professional title of software developerðŸŽ“. These studies allowed me to develop my skills in XML, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax, PHP5, SQL, UML, MySQL and object-oriented programming. It was also an opportunity to put my theoretical learning into practice during a three-month internship, during which I had the chance to develop a web application in PHP5, model a MySQL database and set up unit tests. In 2017, I started my programming career at a startup in Montpellier, in the south of France, where I took part in a project to develop a multiplatform application with Ionic, Cordova and AngularJSðŸ“±. A year later, I made the transition to the public sector. My current role involves analyzing XML flows and resolving incident tickets, as well as contributing to the integration of new colleagues. Passionate about the field of software development, I'm currently studying software engineering and am looking for a challenge in a software development team."
